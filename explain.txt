React Works on VDOM ==>
    DOM ==> Document Object Modal
        ==> Access the element of HTML Code
        ==> CSS (selector) & JavaScript (document)
        ==> Root Element (html)
    
    VDOM
        root ==> Root Element (div id=root)
        inject our code 
            Code <==> VDOM (all operations) ====> DOM
            Code <==> VDOM (all operations) <==== DOM

When We Import From Node Module "moduleName"
When We Import Self Created Module "./moduleName"


React Component
    # basic building block of react
    # re-use
    # It Must Always Start with Capital Letter
    # single parent i.e div or <> </>
    # <> </> ==> JSX Fragment
    # class => className
    # for ==> htmlFor 
    # {this.text} ==> JSX expression

State => 
    # handel component data.
    # when a state changes component re-render
    # class component come with in build state
    # in class this.state ==> readonly
    # in class to update a state ==> setState
    # state are mutable in nature

Props =>
    # send data from parent to child
    # in class, props are spacial object of class
    # props handles a data which we received from parent
    # you will not able change the prop in child component
    # prop are immutable in nature
    # send data of type string, number , boolean , array , object , function

Looping 
    ==> Array ==> .map()
